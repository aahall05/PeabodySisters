        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            The 19th century was a time of dramatic change in regards to education in
            America, and a key contributor to common school reformation was Horace Mann.
            Horace’s wife, Mary Mann, and her sister, Elizabeth Peabody, were
            also education reformers who specialized in the education of young children.
            To ensure the Peabody sisters are not underrepresented in the conversation surrounding
            common school reformation during their time, the goal of this website is to serve as a
            compilation of works related their legacy.
